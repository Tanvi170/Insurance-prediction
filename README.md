This project predicts medical insurance charges based on various user inputs using a trained machine learning model. The project is implemented in Python and deployed as a web application using Streamlit.
Overview
This project leverages machine learning models to estimate medical insurance charges based on user details like age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoking habits, and region. The application is built using:

A Linear Regression model for predictions.
Streamlit for an interactive user interface.
Features
Interactive UI: Users can input their details via sliders and dropdowns.
Prediction: Get an estimated insurance charge instantly.
Performance Metrics: View model performance with Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-Squared scores.
Dataset
The dataset used in this project is insurance.csv, which includes:

Age, Sex, BMI, Children, Smoker, Region, and Charges.
The data is preprocessed to handle categorical variables and scale numeric features.
Technologies Used
Python: Core programming language.
Libraries:
Data Processing: pandas, numpy
Machine Learning: scikit-learn
